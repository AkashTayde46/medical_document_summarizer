# EHR Document Summarizer

EHR Document Summarizer is a robust full-stack application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It empowers healthcare professionals to streamline documentation by allowing easy upload of medical files (PDFs or images), automatic OCR and text extraction, and generation of concise medical summaries powered by **Google Gemini AI**. The application features a modern user interface with drag-and-drop uploads and responsive design via **Tailwind CSS**.
